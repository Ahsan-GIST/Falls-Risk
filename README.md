# Falls-Risk
Balance Impairment (via BBS score) and Fall-Risk Estimation Dataset

IMPORTANT: If you use this dataset, please cite the following paper: 
Ahsan Shahzad, Seunguk Ko, Samgyu Lee, Jeong-A Lee and Kiseon Kim. “Quantitative assessment of balance impairment for fall-risk estimation using wearable triaxial accelerometer”, IEEE Sensors Journal. 

Experiment Protocol and Settings:

Subjects: 23 Elderly people 
Activities Performed: 
  1) Berg Balance Scale (BBS)  - without sensor
  2) Directed Routine - with waist mounted triaxial accelerometer sensor
       a) Timed up and go test (TUGT)
       b) Five times sit to stand test (FTSS)
       c) Alternate step test (AST)
Each subject performed DR tasks twice (2 trials of each test that means 6 data files for each subject). 

Sensor: Accel (+/- 1.5g ) - Shimmer 2R.
Position: Waist(Lower back)
Sampling rate: 41 Hz
